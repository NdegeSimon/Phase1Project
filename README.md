ChatSnap is a fun and interactive web app that lets users explore profile cards one by one. Each card displays a person's image, name, age, bio, and interests, with the option to move to the next profile by clicking a button. Users can also add their own profiles by filling out a form and uploading an image. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ChatSnap delivers a sleek, mobile-friendly user experience—ideal for learning how to work with dynamic data and user interactions.
